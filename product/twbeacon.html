        <p>
            We introduced an exclusively modified beacon technology - Two-way Beacon. Two-way Beacon offers advanced connectivity of devices that communicate to each other over Bluetooth without Internet in an indoor environment. Two-way Beacon transmits pre-programmed signals to a user’s mobile device, so users can immediately respond to Two-way Beacon by tapping devices on their palms.

            Intercommunication without Internet makes our Two-way Beacon unique and distinct from MLBeacon. Apart from broadcasting information to Bluetooth device users, Two-way Beacon allows Bluetooth device owners to promptly communicate with Two-way Beacon itself. Your customers will be able to select products or check stock availability by tapping their Bluetooth devices before they check out.
