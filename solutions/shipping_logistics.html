<h2>Shipping Logistics</h2>
<h4>To improve accuracy in freight tracking</h4>
<p>There is a great likelihood of loss or misarrangement of transported cargo during regular freight delivery from one point to another if freight tracking is not processed properly.</p>
<p>With your own freight-tracking app, Mobilogics' MFi mobile barcode scanners help you immediately scan shipments into logistics system so as to prevent shipments from losing or being misarranged. Shippers can quickly inspect shipments and then input all shipment information to data system, thus greatly improving accuracy for freight tracking.</p>
